# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a submission by **Miranda Gardner** and contains instructions on how to analyze the Human Activity Smartphone dataset.

## **Dataset**

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## **Files**
* `CodeBook.md` a code book describing the variables, the data and processing/manipulations that I performed to tidy the data

* `run_analysis.R` contains the source code that I utilized to follow the 5 learning objectives for this course project:

     1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
     4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each           activity and each subject.
     
* `My_Neat_Data.txt` is the final exported text file after completing all of the steps described above.
